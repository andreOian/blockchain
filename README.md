# blockchain_BBook
A simple example of a blockchain programmed in python containing a simple consensus algorithm with a very simple PoW.
The information on the books is saved on the nodes of the blockchain (educational example), it can be deployed on multiple machines via the "Execute_Blockchain" batch and stopped thanks to the "Initialize_Blockchain" batch. When done on a node on the network, the blockchain saved on it is updated with all the nodes on the network.
